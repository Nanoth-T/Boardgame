# Boardgame Online

This project utilizes a dataset from [Board Games Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sujaykapadnis/board-games)

Our goal is to identify the appropriate features for creating an online version of a board game by following these steps:
1. Cluster groups of board games, then select groups with an average rating above a specified threshold.
2. Develop potential solutions (features of the board game).
3. Verify and find the best solution by using a regression model to predict the average rating.
